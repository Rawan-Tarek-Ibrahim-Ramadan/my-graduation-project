        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), also known as clinical depression, is a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. These symptoms significantly interfere with daily functioning and can cause significant distress.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Biological factors: Imbalances in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine are believed to play a role in MDD.</li>
          <li>Genetic factors: MDD can run in families, suggesting a genetic predisposition.</li>
          <li>Environmental factors: Traumatic life events, such as loss of a loved one, abuse, neglect, or significant life changes, can trigger or contribute to the development of MDD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Persistent sadness or low mood</li>
          <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities</li>
          <li>Changes in appetite or weight</li>
          <li>Sleep disturbances (insomnia or excessive sleep)</li>
          <li>Fatigue or loss of energy</li>
          <li>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt</li>
          <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
          <li>Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Psychotherapy: Talk therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal therapy (IPT), can help individuals with MDD identify and change negative thoughts, develop coping skills, and improve overall well-being.</li>
          <li>Antidepressant medication: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or other antidepressant medications may be prescribed to help alleviate symptoms of MDD.</li>
          <li>Self-care practices: Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and practicing stress-reduction techniques can support overall mental health.</li>
          <li>Support network: Building and maintaining social connections, seeking support from loved ones, and participating in support groups can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation.</li>
