        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent challenges in social interaction, communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Genetic factors: Certain genetic mutations and variants are associated with an increased risk of ASD.</li>
          <li>Environmental factors: Prenatal and early-life environmental influences, such as maternal infections, complications during pregnancy or delivery, and exposure to certain chemicals, may contribute to the development of ASD.</li>
          <li>Neurological factors: Differences in brain structure and function have been observed in individuals with ASD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Challenges in social interaction: Difficulty with nonverbal communication, forming and maintaining relationships, and understanding social cues.</li>
          <li>Communication difficulties: Delayed or atypical language development, challenges in initiating and sustaining conversations, and reliance on repetitive or scripted language.</li>
          <li>Restricted and repetitive behaviors: Engaging in repetitive movements or behaviors, rigid adherence to routines, and intense interests in specific topics.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Behavioral interventions: Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) and other behavioral therapies can help individuals with ASD acquire new skills and reduce challenging behaviors.</li>
          <li>Speech and language therapy: Targeted interventions can assist with improving communication skills and language development.</li>
          <li>Occupational therapy: Occupational therapists can support individuals with ASD in developing adaptive skills and addressing sensory sensitivities.</li>
          <li>Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to manage specific symptoms or co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety or attention difficulties.</li>
