        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), also known as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by persistent impairments in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Genetics: There is a strong genetic component to PDD, with certain genes and genetic mutations being associated with an increased risk.</li>
          <li>Environmental factors: Prenatal and early-life factors, such as maternal infections, exposure to toxins, and complications during pregnancy or childbirth, may contribute to the development of PDD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Impairments in social communication and interaction: Difficulties in social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and developing and maintaining relationships.</li>
          <li>Restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities: Repetitive motor movements, insistence on sameness, restricted interests, and sensory sensitivities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Early intervention: Early identification and intervention, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and social skills training, can help improve outcomes for individuals with PDD.</li>
          <li>Behavioral therapy: Behavioral interventions that target specific symptoms and skill development can be effective in improving social communication, reducing challenging behaviors, and promoting adaptive skills.</li>
          <li>Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to manage co-occurring conditions or specific symptoms associated with PDD, such as anxiety, hyperactivity, or aggression.</li>
          <li>Supportive services: Access to special education services, individualized education plans (IEPs), and support from professionals, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, and speech-language pathologists, can provide additional support for individuals with PDD.</li>
        </ul>
