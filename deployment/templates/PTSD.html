        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. It is characterized by intrusive and distressing symptoms that persist long after the traumatic event has ended.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event: Traumatic events such as physical or sexual assault, natural disasters, accidents, or military combat can trigger the development of PTSD.</li>
          <li>Individual factors: Factors such as a history of previous trauma, childhood adversity, or a family history of mental health disorders can increase the risk of developing PTSD.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Intrusive symptoms: Flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, or emotional distress triggered by reminders of the traumatic event.</li>
          <li>Avoidance symptoms: Avoiding reminders of the traumatic event, emotional numbing, detachment from others, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities.</li>
          <li>Negative alterations in mood and cognition: Negative thoughts, distorted beliefs about oneself or the world, memory problems, and difficulties experiencing positive emotions.</li>
          <li>Arousal and reactivity symptoms: Hypervigilance, irritability, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, and exaggerated startle response.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Psychotherapy: Various forms of therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and exposure therapy, can help individuals with PTSD process their traumatic experiences, reduce symptoms, and improve coping skills.</li>
          <li>Medication: Antidepressants, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be prescribed to help manage symptoms of PTSD.</li>
          <li>Supportive services: Support from family, friends, and support groups can provide emotional support and understanding to individuals with PTSD.</li>
          <li>Self-care strategies: Engaging in self-care activities, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and stress management, can help individuals cope with PTSD symptoms.</li>
        </ul>
