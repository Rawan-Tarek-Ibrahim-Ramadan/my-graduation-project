        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>An Eating Disorder is a mental health condition characterized by abnormal eating habits, severe distress about body weight or shape, and a preoccupation with food and body image.</p>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Genetics: Genetic factors can contribute to the development of eating disorders.</li>
          <li>Psychological factors: Low self-esteem, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction, and negative body image can play a role in the onset of eating disorders.</li>
          <li>Social and cultural factors: Societal pressure to meet certain beauty standards, cultural emphasis on thinness, and exposure to media promoting unrealistic body ideals can contribute to the development of eating disorders.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Anorexia Nervosa: Severe restriction of food intake, fear of weight gain, distorted body image, and excessive exercise.</li>
